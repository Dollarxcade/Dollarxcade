# Shafan Khaja

I’m Shafan, also known online as Boketto or previously known online as Dollarxcade. I am a high school student interested programming and tech. My long-term academic and career focus is in city planning and civil engineering, with programming and data analysis acting as supporting skills.

If you found this README through a social media link, this page is temporary. My full public portfolio website is currently in development, and this README serves as a short snapshot until that is complete.

## Interests, Passions & Goals

I’m interested in data analysis, urban systems, transit, and building small tools that make workflows more efficient. I enjoy breaking down messy or inefficient systems and figuring out how technology can improve decision-making. Long-term, I want to apply these skills in city planning, whether through simulations, custom apps, or data-driven analysis.

## Repository Overview

### Personal Projects  
This repository was originally created for small projects while I was learning to code. I no longer use it regularly since I now create separate repositories for larger, multi-file projects. If I build a simple one-file project that does not warrant its own repository, it will usually be placed here.

### School Projects  
This repository served the same purpose for school-based coding projects. It is mostly inactive now, as I am not pursuing computer science academically, but it remains as an archive of earlier coursework and experiments.

## Coding History

**Grade 6 — JavaScript Foundations**  
I was first introduced to coding through JavaScript during online school in Grade 6. Instead of attending virtual classes consistently, I spent much of that time completing Codecademy JavaScript courses and building small personal projects. I learned primarily through documentation and experimentation, which gave me a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

**Grade 7 — JavaScript Libraries (Sci-Tech)**  
As part of a year-long Genius Hour project, I chose to build a game using JavaScript. I experimented with multiple game development libraries and eventually used Phaser.js. While the final game was not fully functional, the experience taught me how to work with external libraries and manage larger projects.

**Grade 8 — Python Fundamentals**  
In Grade 8, I learned Python through the Codesters platform as part of the Sci-Tech curriculum. This focused on core programming concepts and basic problem-solving using Python.

**Grades 9–10 — SQL, Spreadsheets, and Data Analysis**  
During Grades 9 and 10, my interest in data analysis became more defined. I learned advanced spreadsheet functions and SQL through self-study using W3Schools. One notable project was a stats compiler for a community Valorant tournament, which involved cleaning raw data and generating structured statistics using SQL queries, lookup functions, and complex spreadsheet formulas.

**Grade 11 — Java (Computer Science)**  
In Grade 11, I completed a full computer science course focused on Java using CodeHS. This solidified my understanding of programming fundamentals and object-oriented concepts. One of my main projects was a console-based system that allowed my teacher to retrieve worksheet answers by day and question number.

**Grade 11 — AP Computer Science (Self-Study)**  
After completing most of the Grade 11 curriculum quickly, I used additional class time to study AP Computer Science A. I completed the CodeHS Cortado course, studied core data structures and algorithms, and read the Barron’s AP Computer Science A textbook. I plan to take the AP exam in May 2026.

**Grade 11 — p5.js and Creative Coding**  
In the same course, I learned the p5.js library and used it to build this portfolio site. This introduced me to creative coding, user interaction, and structuring visual programs using JavaScript.

**Grade 11 — Python Simulations and Data Modeling**  
As an extension of my data analysis work, I learned how to run simulations using Python with NumPy and pandas. I built a simulation that modeled future matches in a Valorant league and calculated the probability of teams finishing in specific standings positions. This involved random sampling, aggregation, and tabular analysis.

**Present and Future**  
I am currently continuing my Java studies for AP Computer Science A and CCC preparation while also learning JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS for web development. In the future, I plan to use coding primarily as a tool to support city planning, data-driven decision-making, and personal productivity through custom-built solutions.
